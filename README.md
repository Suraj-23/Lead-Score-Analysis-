# Lead-scoring
Lead Score - Case Study Problem Statement:  An X Education need help to select the most promising leads, i.e. the leads that are most likely to convert into paying customers. The company requires us to build a model wherein you need to assign a lead score to each of the leads such that the customers with higher lead score have a higher conversion chance and the customers with lower lead score have a lower conversion chance. The CEO, in particular, has given a ballpark of the target lead conversion rate to be around 80%.  


Goals and Objectives: There are quite a few goals for this case study.  Build a logistic regression model to assign a lead score between 0 and 100 to each of the leads which can be used by the company to target potential leads. A higher score would mean that the lead is hot, i.e. is most likely to convert whereas a lower score would mean that the lead is cold and will mostly not get converted.  There are some more problems presented by the company which your model should be able to adjust to if the company's requirement changes in the future so you will need to handle these as well. These problems are provided in a separate doc file. Please fill it based on the logistic regression model you got in the first step. Also, make sure you include this in your final PPT where you'll make recommendations.  

Lets divide the entire process into following steps:  
Step 1: Loading and Cleaning Data 
a) Inspecting the Dataframe 
b) Cleaning the Dataframe 
Step 2: Exploratory Data Analysis 
a) Missing value Treatment 
b) Dealing with unique valued columns 
Step 3: Data Visulaization 
a) Univariate Analysis 
b) Bivariate Analysis 
Step 4: Outlier Handling 
Step 5: Train test split 
Step 6: Scaling 
Step 7: Model building 
Step 8: Plotting the ROC Curve 
Step 9: Finding Optimal Cutoff Point 
Step 10: Precision and Recall 
Step 11: Making predictions on the test set
